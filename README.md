# remote-keyboard
This script reads from standard input and maps keys to USB HID gadget

This script can be used on a Raspberry Pi OS that has USB HID gadget configured as described in this blogpost https://myraspberrypiadventure.blogspot.com/2024/07/usb-hid-gadget-with-raspberry-pi-os.html

Primary aim for now is to drive UI remote on a STB with USB HID keyboard support.
