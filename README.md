# remote-keyboard
This script reads from standard input and maps keys to USB HID gadget

This script can be used on Raspberry Pi OS that has USB HID gadget configured as described in this blogpost https://myraspberrypiadventure.blogspot.com/2024/07/usb-hid-gadget-with-raspberry-pi-os.html

Primary aim for now is to drive UI remotely on a STB with USB HID keyboard support.
